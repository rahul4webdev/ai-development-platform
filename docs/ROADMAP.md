## Vision Summary

Enable production deployment and operational maturity of the AI-Driven Autonomous Development Platform, transitioning from feature-complete development to a reliable, self-managing production system that can autonomously handle software development workflows with human oversight only at critical decision points.

---

## Current State Assessment

| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Infrastructure | Complete | Lifecycle Engine v2, Ingestion, Scheduler implemented |
| API Endpoints | Complete | Full REST API for all operations |
| Telegram Bot | Implemented | Awaiting bot token creation |
| Claude CLI Integration | Partial | Installed but requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY |
| Testing Environment | Not Deployed | aitesting.mybd.in configured but not active |
| Production Environment | Not Deployed | ai.mybd.in configured but not active |
| Test Coverage | Scaffold Only | Tests exist but not run in CI |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Skeleton | Needs implementation |

---

## Assumptions

1. VPS at 82.25.110.109 is accessible and operational
2. AlmaLinux 9 + CyberPanel + OpenLiteSpeed stack is functional
3. GitHub repository is the source of truth
4. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY will be provided before Claude execution phases
5. Telegram bot token will be created before bot activation
6. Domain DNS is already configured for aitesting.mybd.in and ai.mybd.in

---

## Constraints

1. **NO AUTONOMOUS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**: All production actions require human approval
2. **DUAL APPROVAL REQUIRED**: Production deployments require two different users
3. **CI GATES ENFORCED**: Cannot deploy without passing tests
4. **IMMUTABLE AUDIT TRAIL**: All actions logged, no modifications allowed
5. **SINGLE ACTIVE JOB PER ASPECT**: Scheduler enforces isolation
6. **70% MINIMUM TEST COVERAGE**: Per TESTING_STRATEGY.md

---

## Explicit Out-of-Scope

1. Database migration from file-based state (future consideration)
2. Multi-VPS horizontal scaling
3. Alternative chat interfaces (Discord, Slack)
4. Custom AI model fine-tuning
5. Mobile native applications
6. Third-party integrations beyond GitHub/Telegram

---

2. Full CHANGE_MODE lifecycle tested
3. Ingestion workflow verified
4. Continuous change cycles working

**Success Criteria**:
- Create project → plan → develop → test → deploy (testing)
- Report bug → fix → test → deploy cycle completes
- External project ingested and registered

---

### Phase D: Production Hardening

**Goal**: Prepare system for production deployment

**Prerequisites**:
- Phase C complete
- All tests passing at >70% coverage

**Deliverables**:
1. Security audit completed
2. Rate limiting verified
3. Degraded mode tested
4. Break-glass rollback tested
5. Dual approval workflow verified

**Success Criteria**:
- No critical/high security issues
- Rate limiting blocks abuse attempts
- System degrades gracefully under load
- Rollback restores previous state correctly
- Cannot self-approve production

---

### Phase E: Production Launch

**Goal**: Deploy to production with full monitoring

**Prerequisites**:
- Phase D complete
- Production approval obtained
- Rollback plan documented

**Deliverables**:
1. Production deployment completed
2. Monitoring dashboards active
3. Alert thresholds configured
4. Documentation finalized

**Success Criteria**:
- System accessible at ai.mybd.in
- Health checks passing
- Error rate < 1%
- Response time < 2s P95

---

### Phase F: Operational Maturity

**Goal**: Achieve autonomous operation with minimal human intervention

**Prerequisites**:
- Phase E complete
- 2 weeks production observation

**Deliverables**:
1. Self-healing capabilities implemented
2. Automated backup verification
3. Capacity planning documented
4. Incident response runbook

**Success Criteria**:
- System recovers from common failures automatically
- Backups verified daily
- Capacity projections for 6 months
- Runbook covers all P1/P2 scenarios

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not provided | Medium | High | Block Claude phases until provided |
| Telegram rate limits | Low | Medium | Existing rate limiting implementation |
| VPS resource exhaustion | Medium | High | Memory limits per worker, monitoring |
| Claude CLI version incompatibility | Low | Medium | Pin to tested version (2.1.12) |
| DNS misconfiguration | Low | High | Verify before deployment |
| Dual approval blocked by single user | Medium | Medium | Document multi-user requirement |

---

## Timeline Guidance

| Phase | Estimated Complexity | Dependencies |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Phase A | Medium | Bot token, VPS access |
| Phase B | Medium | ANTHROPIC_API_KEY |
| Phase C | Large | Phases A+B |
| Phase D | Medium | Phase C |
| Phase E | Small | Phase D + approval |
| Phase F | Large | Phase E + observation |

**Note**: Time estimates deliberately omitted per system policy.

---

## Decision Points Requiring Human Input

1. **Before Phase A**: Telegram bot token creation
2. **Before Phase B**: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY provision
3. **Before Phase E**: Production deployment approval
4. **During Phase E**: Dual approval for go-live
5. **During Phase F**: Acceptance of operational maturity criteria

## Future Enhancement: Project Recovery & Rescue System

**Phase: Post-MVP Enhancement**

**Problem Statement**:
When a project gets stuck at any phase (creation, planning, execution, deployment), there is currently no way to recover without deleting and recreating the project. This is inefficient and loses context.

**Proposed Solution - Intelligent Recovery System**:

### 1. Duplicate Project Detection
- When creating a project that already exists, bot should respond:
  - "Project '{name}' already exists"
  - Options: "View Status", "Resume", "Delete & Recreate"
- Leverage Claude's resume capability to continue from last checkpoint

### 2. Project Rescue Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/rescue <project>` | Show recovery options for stuck project |
| `/retry-job <job_id>` | Retry a failed job from beginning |
| `/resume-job <job_id>` | Resume job using Claude's resume feature |
| `/cancel-job <job_id>` | Cancel a stuck/running job |
| `/reset-phase <project> <phase>` | Reset project to a specific phase |

### 3. Automatic Failure Detection
- Monitor job execution for timeouts (configurable, default 30 min)
- Detect stuck states (no progress for N minutes)
- Auto-notify user via Telegram with rescue options

### 4. State Checkpoints
- Save project state at each phase completion
- Store in `checkpoints/` directory per project
- Enable rollback to any checkpoint

### 5. Claude Resume Integration
- Use `--resume` flag with conversation ID
- Store Claude session IDs in job metadata
- Enable "Continue from where Claude left off"

**Implementation Priority**: Medium (after MVP is stable)

**Dependencies**:
- Stable project creation flow
- Job state machine working correctly
- Claude CLI execution operational

**Success Criteria**:
- User can recover stuck project without data loss
- Resume works from any failed phase
- Less than 5% of projects require manual intervention
